Program Name: Grade Calculations


Program Description:
Final Grade in a course is a combination of Assignments average, Midterm and Final Exam scores. They are weighted differently. Letâ€™s write a program to calculate the Final Calculated Score and the Letter Grade for a student in a course.

Design:
A. INPUT
Define the input variables including name data type. 
int numAssigns;
double input(score for each assignment)
double midterm, final
double midterm, final

B. OUTPUT
Define the output variables including data types. 
double finalScore;
char finalGrade;

C. CALCULATIONS
Describe calculations used by algorithms in step D.  
List all formulas. 
If there are no calculations needed, state there are no calculations.
no calculations
finalScore = ((assignAvg * assignWeight) + (midterm * midtermWeight) + (final * finalWeight))

D. LOGIC and ALGORITHMS
Design the logic of your program using pseudocode or flowcharts. 
Use conditionals, loops, functions or array constructs.
List the steps in transforming inputs into outputs.
